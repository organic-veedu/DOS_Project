The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by
simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an
state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to
continue.
Example: Snapshot at the initial stage:
1. Consider the following resource allocation state with 5 processes and 4 resources: There are
total existing resources of 6 instances of type R1, 7 instances of type R2, 12 instance of type R3
and 12 instances of type R4.
Process  Allocation 	Max
  	 R1 R2 R3 R4 R1 R2 R3 R4
P1 	 0   0  1  2  0  0  1  2
P2 	 2   0  0  0  2  7  5  0
P3 	 0   0  3  4  6  6  5  6
P4 	 2   3  5  4  4  3  5  6
P5 	 0   3  3  2  0  6  5  2
a) Find the content of the need matrix.
b) Is the system in a safe state? If so, give a safe sequence of the process.
c) If P3 will request for 1 more instances of type R2, Can the request be granted immediately or not
